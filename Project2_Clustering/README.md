# Project 2: Data Representations and Clustering

The project is split into 3 parts as described below:

- Part 1 - Clustering on Text Data
- Part 2 - Deep Learning and Clustering of Image Data
- Part 3 - Clustering using both Image and Text

The project is organized into three code files, each handling a distinct segment.
Part 1 & Part 3 developed in local machine, vscode with Jupyter extension.
Part 2 developed in Google Colab.

### Code Files:

- `Part1.ipynb`
- `Part2.ipynb` (extended from the helper_code.ipynb provided in Bruinlearn)
- `Part3.ipynb` (extended from the pokedex_helper.ipynb in Bruinlearn)

### Other Files:

- `ECE219-Proj2-Spec.pdf`
- `Project2_Report.pdf`
- `Pokemon.csv` (text data for part3: pokemon name, types..)

Note: if the image dataset for part 2 and 3 cannot auto download (the logic has implemented) in the notebook, please use the url at the top of the notebook and manually download.
